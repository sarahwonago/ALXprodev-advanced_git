# Overview

**Git-Flow** is a branching model for Git, proposed by Vincent Driessen, that helps developers manage features, releases, and hotfixes in a consistent and scalable way.  
It introduces well-defined roles for branches and helps teams coordinate code changes more effectively.

Git-Flow is particularly beneficial for **large-scale projects** where multiple developers work simultaneously on various aspects of the codebase.

---

## Primary Branch Types

- **main** (or **master**) – production-ready code
- **develop** – ongoing development
- **feature/\*** – new features in progress
- **release/\*** – preparation for production releases
- **hotfix/\*** – critical bug fixes on the main branch

---

## Relevance in the Development Process

Git-Flow improves:

- **Code organization** by clearly separating development stages
- **Team collaboration** through structured branching and merging workflows
- **Code stability** by allowing features to be tested and integrated before reaching production
- **Release management** by isolating release-specific tasks

It is widely adopted in **agile** and **CI/CD** environments, ensuring seamless integration and deployment pipelines while reducing conflicts and regression bugs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this, learners should be able to:

1. Understand the purpose and structure of Git-Flow.
2. Identify the different branch types and their roles.
3. Apply Git-Flow in real-world collaborative development projects.
4. Manage feature development, hotfixes, and release cycles using Git best practices.

---

## Learning Outcomes

Learners will be able to:

- Explain how Git-Flow helps manage large codebases and team contributions.
- Create and manage branches following the Git-Flow model.
- Use Git commands to initiate features, releases, and hotfix branches.
- Integrate Git-Flow into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployments.

## Git-Flow Best Practices

| Best Practice                   | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start with develop**          | Always branch off from `develop` for new features, not `main`.                                      |
| **Feature Isolation**           | Keep each feature in its own branch to reduce merge conflicts.                                      |
| **Merge via Pull Requests**     | Use pull/merge requests for all merges to ensure code review.                                       |
| **Keep main clean**             | Only production-ready code goes into `main`. Never push untested code here.                         |
| **Tag Releases**                | Use Git tags on the `main` branch to mark official release points.                                  |
| **Use hotfix/** for urgent bugs | Apply emergency fixes directly to `main` via a `hotfix/` branch and merge them back into `develop`. |
| **Document your workflow**      | Maintain clear documentation of your Git-Flow in your project’s README or internal wiki.            |

## Common Git-Flow Commands

```bash
git flow init                     # Initialize Git-Flow
git flow feature start <name>     # Start a new feature branch
git flow feature finish <name>    # Finish feature and merge into develop
git flow release start <x.x.x>    # Start a release branch
git flow release finish <x.x.x>   # Merge release into main and develop
git flow hotfix start <x.x.x>     # Start a hotfix branch
git flow hotfix finish <x.x.x>    # Finish hotfix and merge into main & develop
```
